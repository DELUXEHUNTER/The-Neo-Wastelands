# Neo
A total conversion of the base game, adding completely new nations, techs, buildings, terrains, ect... 

The lore for this mod will be written as I go, or if someone would like to write the lore than they may. Anyone who wants to help in any way is welcome to add their ideas, or fix the code, stats, or edit anything if they'd like to, as long as you do not ruin the mod for anyone else and are attempting to improve the mod 

I apologize for the horrible grammar, or unappealing visuals ect... 


Neo, is a mod that I am making inspired by the alpha frontier mod [https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier] and my own story that I've been writing for several months. lore for nations, units, ect... are all either direct copies or changed slightly from their in universe counterpart. I would appreciate help coding and creating ideas, anyone may help as long as they do not ruin the mod for everyone else, I really would appreciate the help


Plans: In the first stages of the mod there will not be many changes other than adding nations, units, research, ect... not changing the game too much, until the later stages of the mod where nations will be removed and much more will be added.

I apologize for the horrible grammar or the unappealing visuals. 

All releases before 1.0 are private releases meant for testing and other purposes.
