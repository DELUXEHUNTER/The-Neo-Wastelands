# Neo

Neo is an unciv mod based on a book/story I'm writing. I felt like I wanted a way to actually give my story a meaning because I'm not skilled enough to make my own game

The lore for nations, units, ect... are all either direct copies or changed slightly from their in universe counterpart. I would appreciate help coding and creating ideas, anyone may help as long as they do not ruin the mod for everyone else, I really would appreciate the help

Plans: In the first stages of the mod there will not be many changes other than adding nations, units, research, ect... not changing the game too much, until the later stages of the mod where nations will be removed and much more will be added.
