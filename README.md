# Neo

Neo, is a mod that I am making inspired by the alpha frontier mod [https://github.com/carriontrooper/Alpha-Frontier] and my own story that I've been writing for several months. lore for nations, units, ect... are all either direct copies or changed slightly from their in universe counterpart. I would appreciate help coding and creating ideas, anyone may help as long as they do not ruin the mod for everyone else, I really would appreciate the help


Plans: In the first stages of the mod there will not be many changes other than adding nations, units, research, ect... not changing the game too much, until the later stages of the mod where nations will be removed and much more will be added.

I apologize for the horrible grammar or the unappealing visuals. 

All releases before 1.0 are private releases meant for testing and other purposes.
